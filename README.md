# Firefox Deployment Example

Customized deployment options for Mozilla Firefox. The goal is primarily to supply good defaults in addition to the boring stuff like bookmarks. uBlock Origin is also included by default. This is all handled using [distribution.ini](Mozilla%20Firefox/distribution/distribution.ini) and the [extensions directory](Mozilla%20Firefox/distribution/extensions).

## Installation

The contents of the "Mozilla Firefox" directory should be copied to the Firefox applicaiton directory. It will be "C:\Program Files\Mozilla Firefox", or "C:\Program Files (x86)\Mozilla Firefox".
